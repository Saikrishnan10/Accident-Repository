# Accident-Repository
Examined accident data over a year to develop a navigation system to avoid accident-prone areas using machine learning techniques.
One of the most common ways in which individuals are affected is by road traffic
accidents, which are more likely to occur in areas with excessive traffic or poor roadway management. The best way to avoid accidents is to avoid these regions and
travel along a safer route. The aim of this research is to develop a navigation system using machine learning that avoids accident-prone areas. The research data
comprises of daily accident reports with location details acquired from the City of
Chicago website, which is an open repository. By using classification models such
as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, the severity of the accident can be determined. The optimal model determined is Random Forest which
has a accuracy, precision, and recall, scores of 94%, 94% and 91% respectively. Once
the severity is determined, the parameters that have the greatest effect on severity
will be identified. The risk score for each location will be determined on the basis of
those parameters, using multiple linear regression. Using the KNN clustering technique, distinct areas or clusters will be identified on the basis of the co-ordinates
and the risk score of the location. The machine learning modelâ€™s outputs will be fed
into the open route service (ORS), and depending on the mode of transportation,
the route map, instructions, and time required for each stage of the journey will
be provided. The model developed in this research project can be implemented in
real time to ensure people travel safely and minimize traffic accidents.
